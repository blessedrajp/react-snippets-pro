## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the JSON snippet file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blessedrajp/react-snippets-pro.git


## 🚀 Usage
Start typing the snippet prefix inside your React or TypeScript files, and VSCode IntelliSense will suggest the corresponding snippet.

Example:
Type rafce → press Tab → React arrow function component boilerplate is generated.

## ⚙️ Configuration
You can customize the prefixes or snippet bodies by modifying the snippet JSON file directly.

The Axios service snippets expect an environment variable:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```
